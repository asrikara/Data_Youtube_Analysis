# Data_Youtube_Analysis

## Purpose

Youtube has become one of the world's largest content platforms in the world, containing content from various different industries from all over the world. With such a large number of creators, channels and videos it can become daunting for both viewers and creators to find and create content that would reach a large audience. Through this project, my goal was to look into some of the insights and analytics that go into creating content that would reach a large audience and go viral. I specifically decided to explore the data science and analytical field and find popular English channels and why they are so popular. 

## Goals

The goals of the project include:

- Learning how to use the Youtube API and extract information using it
- Analyze the data that is extracted using the information, cleaning it and finding insights that will help make decisions in the future
- Display information using various different plots and diagrams to display insights from the data

## Data

This project focused on the top 8 data science and data analytical channels on Youtube. Since this information is changing daily it was difficult to find a data set online that contained the information that I was looking for, so as a result the Youtube API was used instead. 

### Limitations

There are still limitations that come with using the Google Youtube Data API as there is a limit of 10,000 tokens per day. I also only looked the most popular youtube channels in English which would exclude a lot of channels that might be more popular in other languages. 

## Conclusions and Insights

- 'Alex the Analyst' is by far the most subscribed to channel
- 'Guy in a Cube' is the most viewed channel which can be a result from the sheer number of videos which are uploaded to their channel in comparision to the other channels
- 'Recall by Dataiku' seems to have the most "loyal" subscribers with the most subs per 1000 views
- Title length does not have a great correlation to views or likes but most titles seems to range between 20 and 100 characters
- Titles containing emojis tend to have a greater number of views but also have a greater variance so it can be seen as a 'hit or a miss'
- Most videos are between 5 to 12 minutes with videos having the highest like ration being below 100 seconds meaning they are most likely youtube shorts, which showcases the overwhelming takeover of short form content that has been happening recently
- Power BI, SQL and Python are the most viewed topics
- August is the most popular month to upload which can be because it is the month before internships applications and school starting
