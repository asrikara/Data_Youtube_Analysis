# Purpose

Youtube has become one of the world's largest content platforms in the world, containing content from various different industries from all over the world. With such a large number of creators, channels and videos it can become daunting for both viewers and creators to find and create content that would reach a large audience. Through this project, my goal was to look into some of the insights and analytics that go into creating content that would reach a large audience and go viral. I specifically decided to explore the data science and analytical field and find popular English channels and why they are so popular.
