# Data_Youtube_Analysis

## Purpose

Youtube has become one of the world's largest content platforms in the world, containing content from various different industries from all over the world. With such a large number of creators, channels and videos it can become daunting for both viewers and creators to find and create content that would reach a large audience. Through this project, my goal was to look into some of the insights and analytics that go into creating content that would reach a large audience and go viral. I specifically decided to explore the data science and analytical field and find popular English channels and why they are so popular. 

## Goals

The goals of the project include:

- Learning how to use the Youtube API and extract information using it
- Analyze the data that is extracted using the information, cleaning it and finding insights that will help make decisions in the future
- Display information using various different plots and diagrams to display insights from the data

## Data

This project focused on the top 8 data science and data analytical channels on Youtube. Since this information is changing daily it was difficult to find a data set online that contained the information that I was looking for, so as a result the Youtube API was used instead. 

### Limitations

There are still limitations that come with using the Google Youtube Data API as there is a limit of 10,000 tokens per day. I also only looked the most popular youtube channels in English which would exclude a lot of channels that might be more popular in other languages.
